        I want to improve my knowledge of programming with the help of good
        mentors, because during my practice (since i've decided to become
        front-end programmer) i had to find most information by myself. I know,
        that with links to useful lessons and maintaining practice i can reach
        some success (hope, that not "some", but "large").
      </li>
      <li>
        had practise with <i>html</i>, <i>css</i>, <i>js</i>, also used bootstrap during the project
        in <i>angular 4</i> (but I don't have a very deep understanding of last two
        points).

      <li>some pages' layout from <a href="https://uat.doconline.lv/ru" target="blanc">https://uat.doconline.lv/ru</a> (main, about us, contacts and so on).</li>
      <li>
        have some experience of layout (link is 1 point higher). At my first job
        (in bank) i was responsible for the information contained in base of
        knowledge.

        2010-2014 BSU (finance & credit), 2017-... BSUIR (code developer) I
        don't know, how to estimate my level of english, but at the last
        interview it was told to be very good (for IT company). I guess, it's
        about B1-B2.
