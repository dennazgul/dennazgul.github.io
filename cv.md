1. I want to improve my knowledge of programming with the help of good mentors, because during my practice (since i've decided to become front-end programmer) i had to find most information by myself. I know, that with links to useful lessons and maintaining practice i can reach some success (hope, that not "some", but "large")
1. had practise with *html*, *css*, *js*, also used *bootstrap* during the project in *angular 4* (but I don't have a very deep understanding of last two points)
1. https://uat.doconline.lv/ru/aboutUs - some pages layout.
1. have some experience of layout (link is 1 point higher). At my first job (in bank) i was responsible for the information contained in base of knowledge.

1. I don't know, how to estimate my level of english, but at the last interview it was told to be very good (for IT company). I guess, it's about B1-B2.
